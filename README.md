# decision_tree
Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm
The code essentially loads the Iris dataset, performs data visualization to understand the relationships between features and target variable, trains a decision tree classifier on the dataset, and evaluates the classifier's performance on the test set. The final output includes the accuracy score of the classifier and visualizations of the decision tree, classification report, and confusion matrix.
